bio: "I first discovered coding in my early teenage years and it was love at first 'site'. I remember hacking away on a gargantuan white box of a computer, coding in pages in Notepad. Those early sites are now lost to the deep-dark-depths of my old hard drive, but I continued to play around with code as a hobbyist for years thereafter.\nIt wasn’t until later in my life, while pursuing my MBA, that I began to think of software engineering as a career path. At that time, I was working as a carpenter’s apprentice during the day and taking graduate classes at night. While at work, I realized how much I enjoyed building things and solving the complex three-dimensional puzzles that carpentry presents.\nI decided to combine this passion for building with my love for technology. This decision led me to The Fullstack Academy of Code, where I studied software engineering and web development. After completing my studies at Fullstack, I was hired on as a Teaching Fellow, where I mentored and taught aspiring software engineers.\nI then went on to work at Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. and subsequently McKinsey & Co., where I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer. During my tenure at Oppenheimer & Co. and McKinsey, I've worked on numerous applications spanning: geospatial analytic tools, mobile applications, PowerPoint automation scripts, and much more."
